# Noir and UltraHonk benchmarks

This web app provides benchmarks for the UltraHonk prover in the browser on various Noir circuits.

This repo was adapted from
[this](https://noir-lang.org/docs/tutorials/noirjs_app) Noir docs page. It has
been modified to work with Nargo version 1.0.0-beta.0. `package.json` has been
modified to use `@aztec/bb.js` 0.66.0 instead of
`@noir-lang/backend_barretenberg`. It also uses `UltraHonkBackend` instead of
`BarretenbergBackend` (see `main.js`).
